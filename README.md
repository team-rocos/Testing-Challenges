# Testing Challenges
We have two testing challenges.

## Rocos Platform UI Testing
Rocos.io is a SaaS platform, it has a page to allow users to signup with a given invitation code. The signup page validates a user's inputs before sending them to the backend API. It is located at https://portal.rocos.io/signup. 

Your task is to create automated UI tests with your preferred testing framework to cover 5 unhappy paths in the signup process. One of the tests needs to cover the case of an invalid invitation code (invalid invitation code can be constructed using random characters).

## Warehouse Robot Control Testing Plan
Your team has been given a warehouse robot project. The requirements can be found at https://github.com/team-rocos/robot-challenge/tree/main/a-restful. As a QA expert, you've been asked to create a test plan based on the project requirements. One challenge is that your team is under delivery pressure, so you need to think what your team can do to achieve high quality while also meeting the delivery deadline.
