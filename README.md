# Testing Challenges
We have 2 testing challenges.

## Rocos Platform UI Testing
Rocos.io is a SaaS platform, it has a page to allow users to signup with a given invitation code. The signup page validates user's inputs before sending to the backend api. It is located at url https://portal.rocos.io/signup. 

Your task is to create an automated UI tests with your familiar testing framework to cover 5 unhappy paths of the signup form. One of the tests need to cover the invalid invitation code (invalid invitation code can be constructed by ramdom characters).

## Warehouse Robot Control Testing Plan
Your team has been given a Warehouse Robot project. The requirements can be found at repo https://github.com/team-rocos/robot-challenge/tree/main/a-restful. As a testing expertise, you've been asked to initiate a testing plan based on the project requirements. One challenge is that your team is under delivery pressure, so you need to think what your team can do to achieve the high testing quality and also meet the delivery deadline.
